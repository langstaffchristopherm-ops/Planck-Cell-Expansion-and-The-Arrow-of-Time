We present a scale--duality dictionary for the Planck--Cell S/t framework that lets ``cells impersonate cosmos'' whenever instruments are restricted to \emph{dimensionless} observables. With the tick--geometry law $a(k)\propto k^{1/3}$ and similarity map $\mathcal S_\Lambda$, the dispersion retains its form, $a(\Lambda^3k)=\Lambda a(k)$, and the sets $\{\alpha,\ \omega/\omega_0,\ h\nu/k_BT,\ a(k)/a(k_\star)\}$ remain invariant; by contrast, gravitational strength $\alpha_G\propto m^2$ and other absolute scales do not. On this base we build a \emph{Cosmology Bridge}: replace $H(z)$ with $H_{\text{S/t}}=\tfrac13\,\dot k/k$ in the standard distance and sound-horizon integrals, preserving angle/ratio observables while letting absolute rulers and growth test S/t dynamics.


We then replace $\Lambda$CDM knobs with a thermodynamic closure for the comoving first law, $\dot\rho+3H(\rho+p)=\sigma(T,\alpha,\omega_0)$, where $\sigma$ is an entropy-production rate per tick fixed by channel physics. In the limit $\sigma\approx 0$ the framework reproduces radiation/matter scalings; with sustained heating it yields late-time acceleration, turning $H_0$, $r_d$, and $\sigma_8$ into \emph{predictions} rather than inputs.

Because expansion $H>0$ with $\sigma\ge 0$ implies $dS_{\rm prod}/dt>0$, the construction provides a clear \emph{arrow of time} aligned with cosmic expansion.
