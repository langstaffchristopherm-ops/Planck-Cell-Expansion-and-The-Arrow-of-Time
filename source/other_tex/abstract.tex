\section*{Abstract}
We replace geometric expansion with a tick-count law so that the cosmic
scale factor measures accumulated entropy rather than assumed curvature.
A scale-duality dictionary in the Planck-Cell S/t framework lets “cells
impersonate cosmos” when observables are dimensionless. With
$a(k)\propto k^{1/3}$ and similarity map $\mathcal S_\Lambda$, dispersion
retains its form $a(\Lambda^3k)=\Lambda a(k)$, preserving ratios such as
$\{\alpha,\ \omega/\omega_0,\ h\nu/k_BT,\ a(k)/a(k_\star)\}$ while absolute
scales vary. Replacing $H(z)$ with $H_{\text{S/t}}=\tfrac13\,\dot k/k$
in standard distance and sound-horizon integrals reproduces
angle–ratio data yet tests new tick dynamics.

We substitute the $\Lambda$CDM energy law with a thermodynamic closure
$\dot\rho+3H(\rho+p)=\sigma(T,\alpha,\omega_0)$, where $\sigma$ is an
entropy-production rate per tick fixed by channel physics. The limit
$\sigma\!\approx\!0$ recovers radiation and matter eras, while sustained
heating yields late-time acceleration. Because $H>0$ with $\sigma\!\ge\!0$
implies $dS_{\rm prod}/dt>0$, cosmic expansion and the arrow of time
become identical.
