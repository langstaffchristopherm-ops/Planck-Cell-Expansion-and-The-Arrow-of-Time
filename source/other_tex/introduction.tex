\section*{Introduction}

\emph{Planck--Cell Expansion} replaces geometric expansion with a tick--count
law, making the cosmic scale factor a measure of cumulative entropy rather than
curvature.  With $a(k) \propto k^{1/3}$ and $H_{S/t} = \tfrac{1}{3}\,\dot{k}/k$,
the familiar cosmological integrals are recovered by substitution, preserving
angular and ratio observables while turning absolute rulers into probes of
entropy--time dynamics.  A thermodynamic closure
$\dot{\rho} + 3H(\rho + p) = \sigma(T, \alpha, \omega_0)$ links microscopic tick
physics to cosmic acceleration, aligning the universal arrow of time
($\sigma \ge 0$, $H > 0$) with expansion itself.
