\section*{Scope and falsifiability}
This paper applies the \emph{Planck-Cell S/t framework} to cosmic
expansion, replacing geometric curvature with a tick-count law
\(a(k)\propto k^{1/3}\) and a thermodynamic closure
\(\dot{\rho}+3H(\rho+p)=\sigma(T,\alpha,\omega_{0})\).
All claims concern late-time, approximately isotropic domains where
\(H>0\) and entropy production satisfies \(\sigma\ge0\).
The construction preserves dimensionless angle and ratio observables but
predicts specific absolute scalings that can be falsified by observation.
Immediate falsifiers include:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item systematic deviation of the measured expansion ratios
        \(D_{M}(z)/r_{d}\), \(D_{H}(z)/r_{d}\), or
        \(100\,\theta_{\star}\) from the tick-law predictions
        at the few-percent level or larger;
  \item failure of the entropyâ€“production closure
        \(\dot{\rho}+3H(\rho+p)=\sigma\) to reproduce the
        observed late-time acceleration without inserting
        additional parameters;
  \item detection of a negative or vanishing entropy-production rate
        (\(\sigma<0\)) in the expanding branch (\(H>0\)),
        which would reverse the arrow of time;
  \item inconsistent mapping between redshift and tick index
        inferred from independent BAO, CMB, and lensing data.
\end{enumerate}
Any confirmed breakdown of the tick-law scaling,
entropy-production sign, or cross-observable consistency would falsify
the expansion layer of the framework.
