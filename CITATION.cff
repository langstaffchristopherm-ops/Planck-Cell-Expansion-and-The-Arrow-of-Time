title: "Planck-Cell Expansion"
abstract: >
  Replaces geometric expansion with a tick-count law where the scale factor
  a(k) ‚àù k^{1/3} arises from cumulative entropy rather than curvature. 
  The Planck-Cell S/t framework links macroscopic expansion to microscopic
  entropy production, preserving observational integrals of standard cosmology
  while recasting the Hubble parameter as an entropic growth rate.
  Repository contains the release PDF and LaTeX source.
